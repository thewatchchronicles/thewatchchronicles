			<p>Diver watches have become increasingly popular over the years, not only for divers but also for anyone who wants a reliable and durable watch. Diver watches are designed to withstand the harsh underwater environment, making them ideal for any outdoor activities. However, finding a high-quality diver's watch can be a daunting task, especially when you're on a budget. In this article, we'll discuss what makes a good diver's watch, popular brands that make affordable diver's watches in the under $300 price range, and provide recommendations for different types of watches.</p><br>

			<h3>What Makes a Good Diver's Watch?</h3>
			<p>A good diver's watch should be durable, reliable, and have specific features that make it suitable for diving. These features include water resistance, legibility, and a unidirectional rotating bezel. The water resistance rating is a crucial factor to consider when choosing a diver's watch, as it indicates the depth the watch can withstand. A minimum water resistance rating of 200 meters (660 feet) is recommended for a diver's watch. The watch should also have legible markings and a unidirectional rotating bezel that allows divers to track elapsed time underwater.</p><br>
			<h3>Popular Brands for Affordable Diver's Watches Under $300</h3>
			<p>There are several brands that make affordable diver's watches in the under $300 price range, and they include Seiko, Citizen, Orient, and Casio. Seiko is a Japanese watch brand that has been around since 1881 and is known for its high-quality watches. Seiko's SKX007 and SKX013 are popular among divers and watch enthusiasts alike, as they offer an excellent value for their price. Citizen is another Japanese brand that produces affordable and reliable watches. Citizen's Promaster Diver is a popular choice for divers and comes in several color variations. Orient is a Japanese brand that offers affordable automatic watches, including its popular Mako II and Ray II models. Casio is a well-known brand that produces high-quality digital watches, including its G-Shock and Pro-Trek series, which are popular among outdoor enthusiasts.</p><br>

			<h3>Water Resistance and Durability</h3>
			<p>Water resistance and durability are essential factors to consider when choosing a diver's watch. The watch should be water-resistant to a depth of at least 200 meters (660 feet) to ensure that it can withstand the pressure of underwater activities. The watch should also be made of durable materials, such as stainless steel, to ensure that it can withstand harsh environments. Additionally, some watches feature a scratch-resistant sapphire crystal, which is highly recommended for diving and other outdoor activities.</p><br>
			<h3>Automatic vs. Quartz</h3>
			<p>Automatic watches use a mechanical movement to power the watch, while quartz watches use a battery-powered movement. Automatic watches are highly regarded by watch enthusiasts due to their intricate mechanical movements, while quartz watches are known for their accuracy and reliability. Both types of watches have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice ultimately depends on personal preference.</p><br>
			<h3>Rubber vs. Metal Straps</h3>
			<p>The choice between rubber and metal straps is another factor to consider when choosing a diver's watch. Rubber straps are highly recommended for diving due to their durability and flexibility, which allows them to withstand the harsh underwater environment. Metal straps, on the other hand, are highly regarded for their elegance and durability. Ultimately, the choice depends on personal preference and the intended use of the watch.</p><br>
