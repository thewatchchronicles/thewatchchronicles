			<h3>Looks</h3>
			<p>The Seagull 1963 is a reissue of the original Chinese Air Force watch from the 1960s, which was produced by the Tianjin Watch Factory. Priced at around $300, the Seagull 1963 offers a unique blend of vintage aesthetics and modern reliability, making it an attractive option for those seeking a distinctive chronograph watch. Whilst seeing the automatic ST19 movement through the open case-back may be nice from a distance, upon further inspection, the price tag becomes clearer when compared to the finishing found in watches above $1 000.</p><br>
			<h3>Design and Materials</h3>
			<p>The Seagull 1963 features a 38mm stainless steel case with a polished finish, giving it a classic and refined appearance. The watch's acrylic crystal adds to its vintage charm, while the gold-tone applied indices and blued hands provide a touch of elegance. The cream dial is adorned with two sub-dials, a 30-minute counter at 3 o'clock and a small seconds counter at 9 o'clock, as well as a red-tipped central chronograph hand. A brown leather strap with a stainless steel buckle completes the vintage-inspired look as well as a dark green NATO military-style strap.</p><br>
			<h3>Movement</h3>
			<img src="https://theslenderwrist.com/wp-content/uploads/Seagull-1963-caseback.jpg" alt="watch name" style="max-width: 100%;"></br>
			<p>Powering the Seagull 1963 is the hand-wound Seagull ST19 mechanical chronograph movement, which boasts a 42-hour power reserve. This movement is a descendant of the Swiss Venus 175 caliber, which was transferred to China in the 1960s. While the ST19 movement is reliable and accurate, it's essential to note that servicing costs for the Seagull 1963 may exceed the watch's initial price due to the specialized nature of mechanical chronograph movements.</p><br>
