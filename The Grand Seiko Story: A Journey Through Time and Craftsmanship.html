			<h3>The Birth of Grand Seiko</h3>
			<p>The story of Grand Seiko begins in 1960, when the brand was established as a subsidiary of Seiko, a Japanese watchmaking company founded by Kintaro Hattori in 1881. The goal of Grand Seiko was to create a luxury watch that could compete with the best Swiss timepieces in terms of accuracy, durability, and design. To achieve this, the brand's watchmakers dedicated themselves to perfecting their craft and pushing the boundaries of watchmaking technology.</p>
			
			<h3>The First Grand Seiko</h3>
			<p>The first Grand Seiko watch, the Grand Seiko First, was released in 1960. This timepiece was powered by the Caliber 3180, a hand-wound mechanical movement that boasted an impressive accuracy of +12 to -3 seconds per day. The watch featured a gold-filled case, a silver dial with applied gold markers, and the now-iconic Grand Seiko logo at 12 o'clock. The Grand Seiko First set the standard for the brand's commitment to precision and craftsmanship, and it remains a highly sought-after collector's item today.</p>

			<h3>The Pursuit of Accuracy</h3>
			<p>Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Grand Seiko continued to push the boundaries of mechanical watchmaking. In 1966, the brand introduced the 44GS, a watch that featured the first-ever automatic Grand Seiko movement, the Caliber 6245A. This timepiece also introduced the "Grammar of Design," a set of design principles that would come to define the brand's unique aesthetic.</p>
			<p>In 1969, Grand Seiko unveiled the 61GS, a watch powered by the Caliber 6145A, which was the first automatic movement with a high-beat frequency of 36,000 vibrations per hour. This groundbreaking movement allowed for greater accuracy and precision, further solidifying Grand Seiko's reputation as a leader in watchmaking innovation.</p>
			
			<h3>The Quartz Revolution</h3>
			<p>In the 1970s, the watch industry was transformed by the advent of quartz technology. Grand Seiko was quick to embrace this new technology, and in 1970, the brand released the first Grand Seiko quartz watch, the 95GS. This timepiece was powered by the Caliber 95A, a quartz movement that boasted an impressive accuracy of ±5 seconds per year.</p>

			<p>Over the years, Grand Seiko continued to refine its quartz technology, culminating in the introduction of the 9F quartz movement in 1993. This movement, which powers many of the brand's current quartz models, is renowned for its accuracy, durability, and longevity.</p>

			<h3>The Spring Drive Revolution</h3>
			<p>In 1999, Grand Seiko introduced another groundbreaking innovation: the Spring Drive movement. This unique technology combines the best of mechanical and quartz watchmaking, offering the smooth sweep of a mechanical watch with the accuracy of a quartz timepiece. The Spring Drive movement is powered by a mainspring, like a traditional mechanical watch, but it uses a quartz oscillator to regulate the movement's speed, resulting in unparalleled accuracy.</p>
