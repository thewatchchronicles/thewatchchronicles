			<h2><u>Top 15 Watches Under $500 : Affordable Timepieces That Look Expensive</u></h2>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Watches are not just time-telling devices anymore; they have become an essential accessory that completes your outfit. However, not everyone can afford to spend thousands of dollars on a luxury watch. That's why we have curated a list of the top 15 watches under $500. These timepieces not only look expensive but also offer excellent value for money. In this article, we will take a closer look at these watches and why they deserve a spot on your wrist.</p>
			<p>Before we dive into our list, let's go over some basic stats you should keep in mind when shopping for a watch. The diameter refers to the size of the watch face, usually measured in millimeters (mm). Lug-to-lug measures the distance between the lugs, or the parts of the watch that attach to the strap. Strap width and thickness are also important to consider when selecting a watch.</p><br>
			
			<h3>1) Invicta Submariner - Price: Approximately $79</h3>
			<p><i>Diameter: 40mm; Lug-to-Lug: 48mm; Strap Width: 20mm; Thickness: 14mm</i></p><br>
			<img src="https://frankfurt.apollo.olxcdn.com/v1/files/z7mz70dnzy2v2-KZ/image" alt="watch name" style="max-width: 100%;">
			<p>The Invicta Submariner is an affordable and versatile watch that's perfect for those who want to wear a stylish and reliable timepiece without breaking the bank. It features an automatic NH35A movement, a unidirectional bezel, and a water resistance rating of up to 200 meters. The Submariner also comes with a stainless-steel bracelet. Admittedly this watch has taken much of its inspiration from the better known rolex submariner so we'll let you decide on whether you want the cheaper unoriginal invicta or if you'll wait to get the original rolex.</p><br>
