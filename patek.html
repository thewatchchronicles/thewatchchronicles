			<h3>The Birth of the Nautilus (1976)</h3>
			<p>The Nautilus was born in an era when the Swiss watchmaking industry was grappling with the Quartz Crisis. The advent of inexpensive, battery-powered quartz watches from Japan threatened the traditional mechanical watch industry. Patek Philippe, a brand steeped in tradition, responded by venturing into a new territory - luxury sports watches.</p>
			<p>The Nautilus was designed by Gérald Genta, the legendary watch designer who also created the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak. Inspired by the porthole of a transatlantic liner, the Nautilus featured an octagonal bezel, a wide case (42mm, considered oversized at the time), and an integrated bracelet. Its water resistance up to 120 meters was a nod to its nautical inspiration.</p>
			
			<h3>The First Model: Ref. 3700 (1976-1990)</h3>
			<p>The first Nautilus, Ref. 3700, was made of stainless steel, a bold move for a luxury watch at the time. It was powered by the ultra-thin Caliber 28-255 C, based on Jaeger-LeCoultre’s Caliber 920. The dial was a dark blue-black, adorned with horizontal embossed bars and a simple date window. The minimalist design, combined with the robustness of a sports watch, made the Nautilus Ref. 3700 an instant classic.</p>

			<h3>The Evolution: Ref. 3800 and Beyond (1981-Present)</h3>
			<p>In 1981, Patek Philippe introduced the Nautilus Ref. 3800, a slightly smaller version (37.5mm) of the original. This model also introduced new variations, including gold and two-tone versions, and a choice of different dial colors.</p>
			<p>The Nautilus line expanded in the 1990s and 2000s, with the introduction of models with new complications. The Ref. 0 (1998) featured a power reserve indicator, and the Ref. 3712 (2005) added a moon phase and power reserve indicator. In 2006, the Nautilus line was revamped for its 30th anniversary, with the introduction of the Ref. 5711, the successor to the original Ref. 3700.</p>

			<h3>The Nautilus Today</h3>
			<p>Today, the Nautilus line includes a wide range of models, from the simple three-hand Ref. 5711 to models with complications like annual calendars, moon phases, and chronographs. The Nautilus has also embraced precious metals like rose gold and white gold, and even gem-set versions.</p>
			<p>Despite these changes, the core elements of the Nautilus remain the same - the porthole-inspired design, the integrated bracelet, and the blend of sportiness and elegance. The Nautilus continues to be a symbol of Patek Philippe's commitment to precision, craftsmanship, and timeless design.</p>
