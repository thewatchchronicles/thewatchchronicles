			<p>Watches have always been a fashion accessory that has been with us for centuries. From the first pocket watches to the modern-day smartwatches, the watch industry has seen a lot of changes. However, some watch designs have remained popular throughout the years, and the Tissot PRX is one of them. In this article, we will take a closer look at the Tissot PRX, including its 35mm version, compare it to the Tissot PRX Powermatic 80, and name and describe two of the best alternatives to the PRX if it just isn’t your cup of tea.</p><br>
			<h3>The Tissot PRX</h3>
			<p>The Tissot PRX is a watch that was first introduced in 1978. It quickly became a popular watch design of the 1970s and 1980s, characterized by its integrated bracelet and octagonal case shape. The watch's design was a combination of sporty and elegant, making it perfect for various occasions. The Tissot PRX features a quartz ETA movement, a stainless-steel case, and a sapphire crystal. The watch comes with a steel bracelet or a leather strap, depending on the model.</p><br>

			<p>One of the most popular features of the Tissot PRX is its 35mm version. The 35mm version of the Tissot PRX is a smaller version of the original watch, perfect for those who prefer a smaller watch on their wrist. The 35mm version features the same design as the original Tissot PRX, with an integrated bracelet and octagonal case shape.</p><br>

			<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tissot-Unisex-Stainless-Quartz-T1372101104100/dp/B09S6SWPJ4/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3KRYS128GX8ML&keywords=tissot+prx+35mm&qid=1682601357&sprefix=tissot+prx+%2Caps%2C485&sr=8-2" target="_blank">Buy here</a></p>
			<p>Both watches feature stunning sunburst dials but because of their integrated bracelet, you won’t be able to do any switching with your own straps.</p><br>
			<h3>Tissot PRX Powermatic 80</h3>
			<img src="https://monochrome-watches.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tissot-PRX-Powermatic-80-Ice-Blue-Dial-T137.407.11.351.00-lifestyle.jpg" alt="watch name" style="max-width: 100%;">
			<p>The Tissot Powermatic 80 is another popular watch from Tissot and is almost exactly the same as the quartz PRX except for its slightly bigger thickness (10.4 to 10.9), comes in a waffle dial and is only available in 40mm diameter. It features an automatic movement with an 80-hour power reserve, a stainless-steel case, and a sapphire crystal. The Tissot PRX Powermatic 80 comes with a steel bracelet or a leather strap, depending on the model.</p>
